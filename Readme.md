# 2048 Game: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The 2048 game is an addictive puzzle game where the objective is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with a value of 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, but variations with different grid sizes also exist.

## How to Play
* Objective: Combine tiles to reach the 2048 tile.
* Controls:
   * Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles.
   * All tiles slide in the chosen direction, and empty spaces are filled by new tiles with a value of 2 or 4.
   * When two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with their values added together.
* Winning: The game is won when a tile with a value of 2048 is created.
* Scoring: Your final score is determined by the total value of the merged tiles on the grid.
* Strategy: Plan your moves carefully to avoid filling up the grid completely and not being able to make any valid moves.
